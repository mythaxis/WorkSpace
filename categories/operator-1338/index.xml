      <description>It is an article of faith at WorkSpace that at some point you’ll be told. Not because experience bears out this belief, and not because you believe that ultimately it is the right thing that should be done (check your quaint sensibilities at the front desk please), but merely because even in an organisation as paranoid and as demarcated as WorkSpace, the fabric of the place is porous. The walls have ears but they also have tongues—scabrous, rough, blunt proboscides that lap cat-like at the wispy fragments of information pervading from up above to down below.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard Babs. Being human I mean; most days I wish I was like you. A synthetic, mediated consciousness devoid of anxiety, fear, self doubt, and pointless introspection. Today was horrible—don&amp;rsquo;t sigh, I know I say that most days—but honestly, you have no idea (can have no idea) about the near bottomless capacity of crassness that you have plugged me into. Take small talk for example, I mean come on—don&amp;rsquo;t these people even attempt some degree of output filtering?</description>

      <description>It didn’t look like a corpse, but he was very dead. Dead bodies are pitiful; a triple amputee cadaver the colour of dirty pond ice is utterly pathetic, a roadkill would have had more pathos. Devoid of the mobilising energy that used this substandard shell in life, the truncated body was a palimpsest of a lifetime of self harm and useless delusion. Crippled by a dysfunctional endocrine system and a cranky neurochemistry, and bolstered by decades of supposed and imagined derision, this man had wilfully and incrementally reduced his body to a torso and one over-muscled left arm.</description>

Gecko I ain’t.
I’ve been shitting myself since Babs yanked me out of deep REM at five-thirty; not meanly though – no intrathecal microvoltage, Babs has chilled out considerably since the flush has faded from his post-upgrade zeal. His/her newly emergent, more rounded persona is quite agreeable as well, convincingly androgynous (s)he skirts expertly, and eerily, the base level gender determinant that underpins any organic relationship building. Basically (s)he has removed the one major potential divisive element in our new relationship.</description>

      <description>Fast Track is over; apparently I’m a manager now. No epiphanic transformation has occurred, no Damascian de-scaling; perhaps I’m missing some critical genetic component that permits the phase change into ideal mid-management material. So, again, I’m faking it; firstly as a drone-level faux-featly specialist, and now, more holistically, as an embedded, larval agent. Daily I am amazed at the duplicity of my existence, thoroughly compartmentalizing two completely divergent mindsets, one bent on psychological maintenance, the other on the more prosaic physical continuity of survival.</description>

      <description>Week four in Fast Track started with the worst spring storm in twenty years. The tail end of hurricane Sheva, an anomalous El Nino child tempest, tore across the Atlantic in five days and smashed itself first against Ireland and then, barely diminished, romped across South West England into London. For once the faintly hysterical British approach to any weather outside of bucolic norms was justified. Heathrow was closed completely when an aging, fully fuelled, Boeing triple seven was pancaked by wind shear against a primary noise baffle outside Terminal 6.</description>

      <description>Fast Track: Week 2; Day 2.
What a terrible fucking day. Someone died in class. We were half way through &amp;ldquo;Redistribution of Economic Profit Zones: Sino-Consumption Trends&amp;rdquo;, when it happened. I had only got to know Rhiain a little over the past week or so, she was a small, quiet, slight Welsh girl with a lilting accent, only slightly dulled by WorkSpace vernacular and three years of living in Hackney.</description>

      <description>Fast Track: Day 3.
&amp;ldquo;Our envy of others devours us most of all.&amp;quot;
This cheery Power Point statement greets us at 08:01; only WorkSpace could subvert a gloomy Solzhenityism into a management training slide show. After two days of this crushing shit I can only assume that this pithy call to arms is going to form the policy core of yet another exercise in share holder value enhancement credo. The official title of the day’s module is (deep breath):</description>

      <description>WorkSpace boasts a &amp;ldquo;rigorous selection process&amp;rdquo; in their corporate literature. No fucking shit. I am sure that the nervous troupe of newb managers that tottered through the titanium portals of WorkSpace HQ (RL) thought that after a week long interview process their positions would be secure. Yeah, right. Twelve of us pass through the proscribed materials TerrorHurtz detector tunnel in single file; nine come out of the other end into the vast lobby.</description>

      <description>I don’t often get to see 05:30; thanks to Babs, early rises are now, not a normal part, but at least a regular part of what passes for my life these days.
My WorkSpace mandated morning regimen is delightful. A 90-second shower, maximum permitted temperature: 40 Celsius. Oatmeal: tepid. Coffee: decaf. Enjoyment: proscribed. I’m being overly harsh I’m sure; there are upsides: Clean clothes, a fading suit rash, no catheter, fresh-fuckin-air, epic bandwidth.</description>

      <description>There are five of them, all faceless, arrayed behind a bland blonde wood table. They must have applied some sort of management witchcraft review hack to my ocular feed; the rest of the office remains crystal, rendered, clear; but whenever I try to focus on their faces I get macula fuzz-out and a stab of pain in both eyes. Nice touch, even face to face, management interactions are a one-way info transaction.</description>

      <description>I’ve never been to WorkSpace Prime (Tier 2) before, and frankly, it’s fucking weird. And not weird in a weird way; it’s just too normal.
We all do it, winding ourselves up daily with pocket fantasies about how Management are revelling in the glut of resource and matérial that their privilege brings; in our mind’s eye we see them rorting and cavorting in shift-less freedom like a Vegas winner cliché on a bed of paper money.</description>

      <description>WorkSpace Memo
Date stamp: 22-06-2028
Time (EST): 23:47
From the desk of Xiu Chen Wong; VP, Tech Overview for Job Maintenance (Europe)
To all Job Operators, (Implementation notification commencing 01-07-2028, 00:01):
Please Note: As of July 1, 2028 WorkSpace is dropping all support for the Job firmware OS based on the H4DAPI open source kernel. This decision is based on a number of factors, including:
 The growing need for a closed source, securable operating code for the Jobs Reduced WorkSpace tolerance for the undesirable personality memes still present in the open source community Proprietary requirements for an OS that can better manage organic overstretch implications of Confluence and other Total Employment activities  As such, your Job’s will shortly be receiving the appropriate system reformat and rebuild necessary for the deployment of the core code of WorkSpace HapLIS; this is a wholly internally derived and built code set, custom developed for the specialised requirements of WorkSpace All.</description>

      <description>The cell wall fills my entire view, the membrane soaring gelatinously towards the notional roof of the Tank. 10,000 seconds in full virch schlepping my way through several TB of endoplasmic reconfig – basically fixing someone else’s sloppy code. The client is waiting and I’m suffering hard with the basic incompatibility of overdue deadline with Monday morning apathy.
WTF – the Tank construct stutters, then freezes completely. Un-fucking-heard of. Like an old movie from the Sci-Fi Classics channel the entire space looks like it’s been embedded in a crystalline block, even the Prims just hover mid-mod.</description>

      <description>Friday always hurts. Divestment is a bitch; Job does its best, a mild pre-exmmersion palliative analgesic plus some standard reality counselling hypnotics, but still, RL is always a grind at first. Gravity reasserts, data access is torturously slow, cooking – sheesh, and the sheer effort of having to interact on the poverty of the human-only level.
Coarse lumpen humanity everywhere you look. Brains, mouths and tongues forming (so slowly), the info-poor commerce on the pitifully narrow organic bandwidth that is people.</description>

      <description>I’m not going to tell you my name.
That’s SOP I’m afraid for your average WorkSpace employee; constant surveillance tends to breed a certain phobic reaction to divulging personal information unnecessarily. This reticence has a certain pitiful bravado about it; ethnographers early last decade first noticed this trend towards self-censorship on the lowest corporate rungs. Call centre staff in the double oughts, while exposed to the full merciless blast of the futile howling public, instinctively and rapidly learned the power of true names; the substitution of &amp;ldquo;Operator #MT128&amp;rdquo; or similar became commonplace – the only privacy bastion (savagely protected) left in a terminally denuded workspace.</description>

      <description>Abstraction is one of the main efficiency tools employed by WorkSpace. Their pet AIs have exhaustively evolved a number of strategems that ensure that any task, big or giga, can be pared down to a bland and abstract dataset for distributed processing.
Adopting a decentralised marquis cell structure but augmented with a pantopticon omniscience, WorkSpace ingeniously ensures efficient data processing, the risk reduction of corporate responsibility, and yet retains a full and robust capability for the individual recrimination of its component drones.</description>

      <description>Forget food pills, flying cars, everclean jumpsuits and moon holidays – what we got (if we’re lucky) was a Job.
They got some things right – cranial inputs and interface shunts, weakly omniscient AI, fully realised immersion environments: so fucking what. The dependency principle is ever present – data access, comfort, presence, credibility, fiscal viability: all predicated on the maintenance of a stream of fragile income. And at the mercy of a diminishing number of giga-nationals; like the autonomic twitching dermis of a dozing bovine, one errant spasm from these behemoths can snuff you out: PRESS 2 TO SPEAK TO OUR RECONNECTION TEAM&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>DownTime overlays as my clock rolls past 16k seconds. The haematic assay has determined that a rest period is appropriate, Babs initiates the shunt.
A curt text horiscroll rudely bumps the load screen though: &amp;ldquo;Mandatory KPI overview scheduled in 3200 seconds, please ensure dunk readiness to facilitate prompt processing&amp;rdquo;.
I sigh inwardly (my control over autonomic displays of physical frustration is long practised and nothing gets through the loyalty buffer); I suppose it had to happen sooner or later, nearly two weeks in with new Job and no direct avatime yet with management – I was going to have to justify my existence to the man.</description>

Today is the first day in my new Job, it arrives soon. The induction epack told me a courier was scheduled to arrive before nine.

The Job’s here. A big white domed shell made from industrial maize bespattered with a million logos and non-tamper user invalidation warnings. It wishes me a good morning and advises that I have two minutes to position it in my preferred location before it uses its executive override to decide for itself; it goes in the windowless backroom.</description>
