With terrible slowness I swing my weapon around to bear and they open up like swatted leeches, each glottal explosion accompanied by a circumferential shockwave, the guns recoil driving the chequered grips deep into my palms, I can see the LEDs of the ammo select panel partially obscured by my bloodied knuckles.
