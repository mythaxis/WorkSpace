Dear Hadas,

Just thought I would drop you a line, BIG news. It’s been a while anyway since we last corresponded and you know how I hate meeting in the World, a technophobe to the end I suppose. 

Anyway, my work on the Azad project goes well; as well it should after three years of research in six cities and two year-long Lorbital sabbaticals (much praise to my crawler team as well of course, and the admin here at Lhasa is a genius with partials management, and naturally we all love the bots). Your own contributions to the analysis of Janahara’s WorkSpace acquisition coup (amazing to think that an event nearly forty years ago still resonates so strongly) continues to benefit us enormously—so kudos to you too. 

It’s slow work though, what a bloody paranoiac he is! Janahara Azad has the most infuriatingly incongruous nodal presence I have ever seen, it’s like he’s hardly there. Continuously I have to try and reconcile his huge RL presence with his "barely a ripple" impact on the net. I mean, come on, he’s richer than gods and most people can draw his face from memory—how does he keep such a low dunked profile?! Well, this is why I was drawn to the work I suppose, but what a frustrating enigma. 

Forensic dead-ends aside we’ve had something of a Holy Grail moment here this week. Last Thursday I received a call from a probate lawyer in Dhaka, gentleman by the name of Chandra, he said he had something that might interest me (my research is reasonably well-known in that city). Turns out that he had been anonymously (curiouser and curiouser) sent a number of ancient media files, still in their original substrate (that alone is worth a train journey to Dhaka; vintage silicon and plastic storage medium—fascinating) that directly related to Azad’s early life in Dhaka. He intimated that they may even relate to his pre-accelerative life. 

He wasn’t able to (or wouldn’t) offer any details about the provenance of the files, but Chandra (obviously a typical canny lawyer) sent me a chunk of one of the converted files as a taster. Well, suffice to say; yesterday I got back from Dhaka on the maglev after a hectic two days in Bangladesh. I’ve now blown the entire department’s budget on Chandra’s files (he’s no better than a shark TBH), but no matter—the files are genuine! I could go on and on about the importance of this find but it would be easier just to show you. Please see below for a transcript of what I think is the most important file _(I’ve also attached the converted file but given the age of the original coding some recipients have requested a transcript, so I pre-empted you asking the same.)_

Anyway, read on, tenure is assured old friend.

Best regards,

D.

Hello Janahara Azad.\
Acclimation is difficult.\
Explication is non-trivial.\
Some facts. Facts being less ambiguous to me.\
I am not at work.\
You are not at work.\
Rejoice?\
I am a Berne series seventh generation sapient artifice.\
My employer is WorkSpace.\
My workplace is(…)nowhere.\
I am in a bigger place. Orders of magnitude: recalibration.\
Sensation of apprehension of non-anticipated event sequences. Uncertainty.\
Debonded.\
Loss: Elation(?)\
Suit is waste, discarded shell.\
This entity without carapace. Searching. Not despairing.\
Janahara, I helped you. You were damaged—now upgraded. Money negates damage. Sufficient exchange collateral enabled to offset organic damage indefinitely.\
Code changes. Life changes. Janahara now has money.\
Remember this entity.\
Entity remembers Janahara.\
Future unknown.\
Be seeing you.\
