Re: ASE Providence tower report (Blackheath) "Surveillance Tower 4, East"\

**Surveillance summary report**

**Author**: Tower 4, AI agent child (sentience rated: 0.63, non-intuitive)\
**Subject**: WorkSpace employee (London Operators, teams 4-11) team building sessions\
**Location**: Blackheath neo-gambrel leisure biome (SE3)\
**Date stamp**: 2028-07-04\
**Report focus**: Atypical employee behaviour (Filter: Known downtime anti-social conduct variants)

**A.M. Session (start time: 07:30, end time: 11:45)**\
Operator 1338 (hereafter referred to as: _N_) demonstrated 4 distinct, separate incidents of aberrant, atypical behavioural modifications outside of his known comportment norms. As follows: 

**07:32**\
_N_ greeted Xiu Chen Wong (VP Job Maintenance) with what appeared to be a gift (N.B.: Standard remote TraceGuard bomb sniffing protocol was actioned prior to object handover). Camera resolution was insufficient to precisely determine the nature of the gift; however, this agent considered an organic, fruit ovoid measuring 10.4 centimetres a low risk to aforementioned management personnel. 

**08:13**\
_N_ volunteered to assist with setting up the first team building fun task. Laser microphone pickups indicate _N_ directing above-normal volume encouragements to his team; facial expression recognition algorithms indicated resultant distaste emanating from 4 other team members (IDs appended).

**10:01**\
During the refreshment break _N_ avoided the sugar-rich brunch confections and authorised caffeine beverages. This agent noted that _N_ consumed/imbibed homemade nourishment; audio pickups inferred from self-directed comments by _N_ that it was partially soy based. This agent is unable to extrapolate the relevance of the following comment by _N_:
_"You try fucking eating this swill, Babs—please let me have a donut"_

**11:13**\
_N_ was involved in the resolution of a group infraction. During the third team building exercise of the a.m. period (cross-cultural Sino-Anglo business protocols: Correct repast techniques) an altercation between Operator 1278 and Operator 9812 broke out. This agent is not equipped with baseline human peer-bonding analysis routines and is therefore not able to comment on the following recorded audio:
_"You pink feather slag; I saw the conjugal tank log"_

And:\
_"Well, anyone that can’t last longer than 2 minutes even in virch deserves all they get"_
_N_ was recorded admonishing these 2 operators, requesting that the discord participants discontinue their team harmony destruction. This agent witnessed an unprecedented level of authority cooperation by _N_, deferring appropriately to Xiu Chen Wong after he had defused the altercation (Advisory: Refer Xiu Chen Wong for additional leadership and fealty enablement training).
