Whether you are reading this at my industrial tribunal, as a data archaeologist student, or as drone level sysadmin clearing space off a grandfathered WorkSpace database, I hope it brings you some small distraction from the otherwise humdrum irritations of your work day.

This is deep backchannel, as far as I can tell no one has broken my crypto yet – my analytics show zero – so the photons striking whatever passes for eyes where you’re at are conveying bona fide, grass roots, uncensored serf level worker angst. 

My story starts here: _[Emotional Machine](/2008/03/06/emotional-machine/)_. New jobs are always a bitch but the tone was certainly set early and hard for me. A no frills _[Operator](/2008/04/09/bullet-point-time/)_ job, a reluctant, tiny cog in the WorkSpace corporation.

Against all my expectations it was a swift and uncomfortable elevation from a macjob level position in WorkSpace development, to an unwilling Cat's Paw of a faceless, corporate WorkSpace management team. Some malign serendipity meant that I was forced into a clandestine investigation into an [industrial espionage](/2008/04/17/quizling/) event that looked like it may reach deep into the upper levels of WorkSpace.

Previously ensconced in a bulky, non-motile, [immersion Job](/2008/03/09/job/), I am now endowed with a bonded, [endo-skeletal Job](/2008/04/23/the-defiant-one/) - a privilege normally the preserve of upper management. My previous Job AI has been ported with me, a grumpy, quasi-sentient mentality that I have nicknamed: Babs.

These records may ostensibly present as a diary, but a writer's vanity suggests that future readers may like some introduction into the dense and unnecessarily complex argot of the WorkSpace world.

## A Glossary

**WorkSpace**: A [sprawling, multinational conglomerate](/2008/10/21/what-its-like-not-to-believe/) of Brobdingnagian proportions. Activities range from: energy production and distribution, to orbital factory platforms, to industrial waste disposal, to childcare. 

**Jobs**: Jobs are [AI-enabled, prosthetic symbiotes](/2008/03/09/job/). In a (successful) attempt to substantially enhance worker productivity, each employee at WorkSpace is bonded, either endo-organically or via an enveloping exoskeleton, with their Job. The Jobs assist, either with processing capacity or gross physical enhancement, with the tasks that WorkSpace set their employees.

**Confluence**: WorkSpace operates a "total employment" policy. This entails the participation of its employees in a [grid data processing technique](/2008/03/19/gives-god-head/) that utilises both organic and machine intelligences. Managed by AIs, this process is mandatory for all WorkSpace employees.

**Petabook**: Standard WorkSpace issue PDA. Provides high capacity data storage and collectively the Petabooks help form an international wireless proprietary data network for WorkSpace. 

**TankSpace**: The shared, [virtual immersion environments](/2008/04/09/bullet-point-time/) used extensively throughout WorkSpace. These spaces are accessed via a number of sensory and EEG interface technologies; direct cerebral input has not yet been achieved.

**Dunking/Dunktime**: Anecdotal/slang term for the act of sensory immersion in a virtual environment.

**The Gaunt**: [Physical headquarters for WorkSpace (UK)](/2008/04/23/the-defiant-one/) located in London. The Gaunt has a virtual (virch) analogue called WorkSpace Prime. 

**[Involution](/2008/07/08/dead-peasants-society/)**: A term relating to an evolving corporate tendency to close ranks against undesirable economic and cultural conditions.

**FastTrack**: [Accelerated management training programme](/2008/06/01/moral-hazard/) only available to the very best WorkSpace employees. 

**SARCOS**: A type of ex-military, [powered exoskeleton suit](/2008/04/26/sisyphus-rising/) used in construction and heavy lifting tasks. 

**Kashem Corp**: Bangladeshi-based [subsidiary of WorkSpac](/2008/04/27/noman/)e, primary activities include macro-scale industrial deconstruction and disposal. 

**Janahara Azad**: The [mysterious south Asian personage](/2008/05/01/motherless-child/) behind the hostile acquisition of WorkSpace during the third decade of the twenty-first century. 

**Life after WorkSpace (LAW)**: Quasi-legal, self help counselling group. [LAW helps disenfranchised ex-WorkSpace employees](/2008/05/25/acclimation/) adjust to life on the outside.

**Formalising Externality (FE)**: WorkSpace employee management technique used to enhance productivity and increase revenue. Characterised by insanely ambitious performance targets and employee cantered blame dynamics, FE typifies the WorkSpace approach to employee fostering. 

**Newev**: Generic term relating to AI technologies and personalities. 

**The Chimneys**: [Subterranean accommodation](/2008/07/31/bullpup/) reserved for senior WorkSpace management personnel; located below The Gaunt. 

**Nodal Identification**: Research tool used to locate and categorise pivotal historical events.

**Neo-con (neo-conscience)**: AI variant used to supply prosthetic morality frameworks to psychopathic WorkSpace employees.

**Pardis Hospice**: Located in Southern Afganistan, the [Pardis Hospice](/2009/02/10/out-patient/) is a WorkSpace sponsored warfare mitigation initiative. Providing medical and counselling care to the victims of yet another branch of WorkSpace - a combat revenue programme - the Pardis Hospice is a poorly funded, ailing hedge against the necessities of global profit generation.

**Job (Therapy model)**: A specialised Job variant designed to provide a safe, [virtual counselling environment](/2009/03/08/ratchet/). Optimised for empathy enhancement, the Therapy Job provides mental healthcare specialists a unique insight into the suffering of their patients.

> WorkSpace is a episodic narrative located in a fictional, near-future context. WorkSpace may ostensibly present as a science fiction story, but at its core is an examination of the rage and despair inducing frustrations of life in a modern workplace.\
