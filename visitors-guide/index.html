<p>Whether you are reading this at my industrial tribunal, as a data archaeologist student, or as drone level sysadmin clearing space off a grandfathered WorkSpace database, I hope it brings you some small distraction from the otherwise humdrum irritations of your work day.</p>
<p>This is deep backchannel, as far as I can tell no one has broken my crypto yet – my analytics show zero – so the photons striking whatever passes for eyes where you’re at are conveying bona fide, grass roots, uncensored serf level worker angst.</p>
<p>My story starts here: <em><a href="../2008/03/06/emotional-machine/">Emotional Machine</a></em>. New jobs are always a bitch but the tone was certainly set early and hard for me. A no frills <em><a href="../2008/04/09/bullet-point-time/">Operator</a></em> job, a reluctant, tiny cog in the WorkSpace corporation.</p>
<p>Against all my expectations it was a swift and uncomfortable elevation from a macjob level position in WorkSpace development, to an unwilling Cat&rsquo;s Paw of a faceless, corporate WorkSpace management team. Some malign serendipity meant that I was forced into a clandestine investigation into an <a href="../2008/04/17/quizling/">industrial espionage</a> event that looked like it may reach deep into the upper levels of WorkSpace.</p>
<p>Previously ensconced in a bulky, non-motile, <a href="../2008/03/09/job/">immersion Job</a>, I am now endowed with a bonded, <a href="../2008/04/23/the-defiant-one/">endo-skeletal Job</a> - a privilege normally the preserve of upper management. My previous Job AI has been ported with me, a grumpy, quasi-sentient mentality that I have nicknamed: Babs.</p>
<p>These records may ostensibly present as a diary, but a writer&rsquo;s vanity suggests that future readers may like some introduction into the dense and unnecessarily complex argot of the WorkSpace world.</p>
<h2 id="a-glossary">A Glossary</h2>
<p><strong>WorkSpace</strong>: A <a href="../2008/10/21/what-its-like-not-to-believe/">sprawling, multinational conglomerate</a> of Brobdingnagian proportions. Activities range from: energy production and distribution, to orbital factory platforms, to industrial waste disposal, to childcare.</p>
<p><strong>Jobs</strong>: Jobs are <a href="../2008/03/09/job/">AI-enabled, prosthetic symbiotes</a>. In a (successful) attempt to substantially enhance worker productivity, each employee at WorkSpace is bonded, either endo-organically or via an enveloping exoskeleton, with their Job. The Jobs assist, either with processing capacity or gross physical enhancement, with the tasks that WorkSpace set their employees.</p>
<p><strong>Confluence</strong>: WorkSpace operates a &ldquo;total employment&rdquo; policy. This entails the participation of its employees in a <a href="../2008/03/19/gives-god-head/">grid data processing technique</a> that utilises both organic and machine intelligences. Managed by AIs, this process is mandatory for all WorkSpace employees.</p>
<p><strong>Petabook</strong>: Standard WorkSpace issue PDA. Provides high capacity data storage and collectively the Petabooks help form an international wireless proprietary data network for WorkSpace.</p>
<p><strong>TankSpace</strong>: The shared, <a href="../2008/04/09/bullet-point-time/">virtual immersion environments</a> used extensively throughout WorkSpace. These spaces are accessed via a number of sensory and EEG interface technologies; direct cerebral input has not yet been achieved.</p>

</a></p>
<p><strong>Dunking/Dunktime</strong>: Anecdotal/slang term for the act of sensory immersion in a virtual environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Gaunt</strong>: <a href="../2008/04/23/the-defiant-one/">Physical headquarters for WorkSpace (UK)</a> located in London. The Gaunt has a virtual (virch) analogue called WorkSpace Prime.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../2008/07/08/dead-peasants-society/">Involution</a></strong>: A term relating to an evolving corporate tendency to close ranks against undesirable economic and cultural conditions.</p>
<p><strong>FastTrack</strong>: <a href="../2008/06/01/moral-hazard/">Accelerated management training programme</a> only available to the very best WorkSpace employees.</p>
<p><strong>SARCOS</strong>: A type of ex-military, <a href="../2008/04/26/sisyphus-rising/">powered exoskeleton suit</a> used in construction and heavy lifting tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Kashem Corp</strong>: Bangladeshi-based <a href="../2008/04/27/noman/">subsidiary of WorkSpac</a>e, primary activities include macro-scale industrial deconstruction and disposal.</p>
<p><strong>Janahara Azad</strong>: The <a href="../2008/05/01/motherless-child/">mysterious south Asian personage</a> behind the hostile acquisition of WorkSpace during the third decade of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p><strong>Life after WorkSpace (LAW)</strong>: Quasi-legal, self help counselling group. <a href="../2008/05/25/acclimation/">LAW helps disenfranchised ex-WorkSpace employees</a> adjust to life on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>Formalising Externality (FE)</strong>: WorkSpace employee management technique used to enhance productivity and increase revenue. Characterised by insanely ambitious performance targets and employee cantered blame dynamics, FE typifies the WorkSpace approach to employee fostering.</p>
<p><strong>Newev</strong>: Generic term relating to AI technologies and personalities.</p>
<p><strong>The Chimneys</strong>: <a href="../2008/07/31/bullpup/">Subterranean accommodation</a> reserved for senior WorkSpace management personnel; located below The Gaunt.</p>
<p><strong>Nodal Identification</strong>: Research tool used to locate and categorise pivotal historical events.</p>
<p><strong>Neo-con (neo-conscience)</strong>: AI variant used to supply prosthetic morality frameworks to psychopathic WorkSpace employees.</p>
<p><strong>Pardis Hospice</strong>: Located in Southern Afganistan, the <a href="../2009/02/10/out-patient/">Pardis Hospice</a> is a WorkSpace sponsored warfare mitigation initiative. Providing medical and counselling care to the victims of yet another branch of WorkSpace - a combat revenue programme - the Pardis Hospice is a poorly funded, ailing hedge against the necessities of global profit generation.</p>
<p><strong>Job (Therapy model)</strong>: A specialised Job variant designed to provide a safe, <a href="../2009/03/08/ratchet/">virtual counselling environment</a>. Optimised for empathy enhancement, the Therapy Job provides mental healthcare specialists a unique insight into the suffering of their patients.</p>
