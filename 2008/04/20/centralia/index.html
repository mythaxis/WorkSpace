<p><strong>Surveillance summary report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: Tower 4, AI agent child (sentience rated: 0.63, non-intuitive)<br>
<strong>Subject</strong>: WorkSpace employee (London Operators, teams 4-11) team building sessions<br>
<strong>Location</strong>: Blackheath neo-gambrel leisure biome (SE3)<br>
<strong>Date stamp</strong>: 2028-07-04<br>
<strong>Report focus</strong>: Atypical employee behaviour (Filter: Known downtime anti-social conduct variants)</p>
<p><strong>A.M. Session (start time: 07:30, end time: 11:45)</strong><br>
Operator 1338 (hereafter referred to as: <em>N</em>) demonstrated 4 distinct, separate incidents of aberrant, atypical behavioural modifications outside of his known comportment norms. As follows:</p>
<p><strong>07:32</strong><br>
<em>N</em> greeted Xiu Chen Wong (VP Job Maintenance) with what appeared to be a gift (N.B.: Standard remote TraceGuard bomb sniffing protocol was actioned prior to object handover). Camera resolution was insufficient to precisely determine the nature of the gift; however, this agent considered an organic, fruit ovoid measuring 10.4 centimetres a low risk to aforementioned management personnel.</p>
<p><strong>08:13</strong><br>
<em>N</em> volunteered to assist with setting up the first team building fun task. Laser microphone pickups indicate <em>N</em> directing above-normal volume encouragements to his team; facial expression recognition algorithms indicated resultant distaste emanating from 4 other team members (IDs appended).</p>
<p><strong>10:01</strong><br>
During the refreshment break <em>N</em> avoided the sugar-rich brunch confections and authorised caffeine beverages. This agent noted that <em>N</em> consumed/imbibed homemade nourishment; audio pickups inferred from self-directed comments by <em>N</em> that it was partially soy based. This agent is unable to extrapolate the relevance of the following comment by <em>N</em>:
<em>&ldquo;You try fucking eating this swill, Babs—please let me have a donut&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>11:13</strong><br>
<em>N</em> was involved in the resolution of a group infraction. During the third team building exercise of the a.m. period (cross-cultural Sino-Anglo business protocols: Correct repast techniques) an altercation between Operator 1278 and Operator 9812 broke out. This agent is not equipped with baseline human peer-bonding analysis routines and is therefore not able to comment on the following recorded audio:
<em>&ldquo;You pink feather slag; I saw the conjugal tank log&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>And:<br>
<em>&ldquo;Well, anyone that can’t last longer than 2 minutes even in virch deserves all they get&rdquo;</em>
<em>N</em> was recorded admonishing these 2 operators, requesting that the discord participants discontinue their team harmony destruction. This agent witnessed an unprecedented level of authority cooperation by <em>N</em>, deferring appropriately to Xiu Chen Wong after he had defused the altercation (Advisory: Refer Xiu Chen Wong for additional leadership and fealty enablement training).</p>
<hr>
<p>(Plain text summary concludes. Please see appended LISP files for raw AI agent output/analysis.)</p>
<p>Further inquiries about this report should be directed to the Coffle-class AI overview committee at the MoJ (<a href="mailto:bootstrap@ministryofjustice.org">bootstrap@ministryofjustice.org</a>).</p>
<p>Report concludes. Have a nice day.</p>
