        <article role="article" class="flex-container"><p><strong>The Lucas Filter</strong> is very useful tool for handling the banalities and frankly distressing high frequency of boredom interludes that modern life throws up. Basically, using a familiar and easy to remember set of Star Wars memes practically any situation can be rendered tolerable and/or fleetingly amusing. For example: Stuck in a dead end telesales job flogging marginal products in a saturated market? Use the <strong>Sabre Meme</strong>: Mentally substitute your normal, deeply average product for a notional light sabre competitive product. A typical cold call might go as follows: <strong><em>&ldquo;Hello, is that the Jedi Council?&quot;</em></strong> <strong><em>Yes, how may I direct your call?</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;Please may I speak with you main Jedi equipment decision maker?</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;That will be Mace Windu, putting you through&hellip;&quot;</em></strong> <strong><em>click&hellip;whrrr&hellip;chirp</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;This is Windu&rdquo;</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;Hello Jedi Windu, my name is Droga Jax, I&rsquo;m calling from a company called LightCosh, we sell a high qualiy range of combat armament for the discerning Jedi. May I ask what type of primary weapon you use?&quot;</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;A light sabre *sigh*&quot;</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;Oh really, how has that ownership been for you, Jedi sir?&quot;</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;Fine. Will this take long? I have a council meeting in 20 minutes&rdquo;</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;Of course, I appreciate you are a busy man, I just wanted to introduce you our flagship jedi weapon offering, the LightCosh. this innovative anti-personnel weapon is proven to deflect 4% more blaster rounds than a conventional light sabre, and is offered with a 2 year guarantee with a 50% refund in the event of your death or untimely carbon freezing.&quot;</em></strong> <strong><em>&ldquo;Of, for fuc&hellip;&quot;</em></strong> <em>Click, brrrr&hellip;.</em> So you can see how the most mundane of interactions can be rendered a little more tolerable with the application of this useful device. Other applications of this filter could include: <strong>The Jabba Palace Meme</strong>: I imagine that much like millions of other employees you are beset at all sides by a legion of fucking morons, either your direct colleagues or some sort of terrible shower of line managers and the like. If, on a rainy Wednesday, follow a hollow and life crushing annual performance review simply perform a find and replace routine on your colleagues appearances using denizens from jabba&rsquo;s palace as replacement templates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Derek from accounts?</strong> Fuck you Bantha fodder, just step a little to the right please..?</li>
<li><strong>Policy adherence officer blues?</strong> Eat this thermal detonator Sarah, your interminable accounts of your boring weekends on your moisture farm make me want to die.</li>
<li><strong>Is the MD visiting this week?</strong> Imagine the chain digging incrementally into her flabby neck as your metal gusset abrades uncomfortably against your groin.</li>
<li><strong>Stuttering, no-mark from IT wont fix your PC?</strong> You&rsquo;re basically C3PO without the marginal cachet of a gay following; come the rebel victory you&rsquo;ll be first up against the re-processing sheds.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so it goes, infinite applications, endless gallows humour&hellip;</p>
