Modern life is a rich breeding ground for all manner of near instantaneous ignitions of fury. This is a phenomena that warrants some examination, not least because this healthy state is increasingly proscribed by an ever growing muffler of involuntary social restraint. Whoa, nearly lost my shit then, sorry - what I want to focus on here briefly is a narrow band of specialised vehicular incurred wrath. To wit: The commute. <em>(Firstly though, a caveat, or proviso - I&rsquo;m always right here - so what you might in the future confuse with arrogance or hubris is just me being right).</em> The Commute:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drivers:</strong> All cunts (apart from me).</li>
<li><strong>Commuters</strong>: Temporally-specific cunts.</li>
<li><strong>Pocket Hitler lane-Nazis on off-ramp queues</strong>: Cunts.</li>
<li><strong>Panel battered tail-gating car crocodiles in the outside lane woefully exchanging insurance details</strong>: Uber-cunts.</li>
<li><strong>Gesticulating school run martinets in SUVs</strong>: Oh my fucking God.</li>
<li><strong>Magpies</strong>: Spooky.</li>
<li><strong>Fog-lights during the day</strong>: Come the revolution&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Commercial radio DJs:</strong> Definitely all cunts.</li>
<li><strong>Having to work at the end of the commute</strong>: Cuntish.</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude: I&rsquo;m not a good morning person, and even if I was they&rsquo;d still be all cunts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carbon cultists:</strong> Etiolated spawn of the devil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oops, that&rsquo;s next weeks&hellip;</p>
