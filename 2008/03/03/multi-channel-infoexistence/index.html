<p>Despite any corporate claims or hype to the contrary, this is not the distillation of several cutting-edge technologies fused into the definitive online gaming experience; but rather the tottering baby steps of a promising toddler, not yet potty trained <em>(but thoroughly potty mouthed)</em>. Our ability to adequately adapt into this dimly lit shared online space demonstrates a fluidic interactive poise that can overcome lag, screenburn and agonising gamer’s hunch whilst still maintaining a decent quality of trash talk.</p>
<p>We are a fleeting breed, no longer young, not yet old; bootstrapping the legacy of a century’s telephone usage (and its own modest nullspace), we bridge the gap between old-school with its needs planted firmly in the physical and the soon-to-be stripped down avatards of the near future. These bred-for-space things of pure energy will cast off the shackles of RL, be it via the Gibson jack, or the Sterling virch, and soar effortlessly, first through the consensual shared space of the game worlds, and after that the datasphere of the whole world – but yet still squealing away 247 that they pwned you, or that you are gay, or that your mom’s a whore, or you suck cocks, or  <em>it&rsquo;s</em> <em>so unfair</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The futures bright, the future’s a moron.</strong></p>
