<p>Last night I spent an agreeable couple of hours or so playing Call of Duty 4 (Xbox Live) with several mates (1 x UK, 2 x USA); together we comprised a party of four, playing in several public Domination games – naturally we were awesome.</p>
<p>What struck me was our collective smoothness in effecting the transition into the gamespace environment; whilst not having had any RL facetime with the US members of our team for several years, my UK based friend and I segued effortlessly into the necessary social dynamic demanded by the lower bandwidth interactive space that is this (frankly) cumbersome gaming amalgam: high(ish)-speed internet, a VoIP connection, mid-level AV kit and some proprietary MS gear.</p>
<p>Despite any corporate claims or hype to the contrary, this is not the distillation of several cutting-edge technologies fused into the definitive online gaming experience; but rather the tottering baby steps of a promising toddler, not yet potty trained <em>(but thoroughly potty mouthed)</em>. Our ability to adequately adapt into this dimly lit shared online space demonstrates a fluidic interactive poise that can overcome lag, screenburn and agonising gamer’s hunch whilst still maintaining a decent quality of trash talk.</p>
<p>We are a fleeting breed, no longer young, not yet old; bootstrapping the legacy of a century’s telephone usage (and its own modest nullspace), we bridge the gap between old-school with its needs planted firmly in the physical and the soon-to-be stripped down avatards of the near future. These bred-for-space things of pure energy will cast off the shackles of RL, be it via the Gibson jack, or the Sterling virch, and soar effortlessly, first through the consensual shared space of the game worlds, and after that the datasphere of the whole world – but yet still squealing away 247 that they pwned you, or that you are gay, or that your mom’s a whore, or you suck cocks, or <em>it&rsquo;s so unfair</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The futures bright, the future’s a moron.</strong></p>
